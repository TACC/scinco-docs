What is SCINCO?
===============

The Scinco project project at TACC provides an interactive computing platform that augments and complements batch computing capabilities available today within science gateways. SCINCO combines container technology and state-of-the-art open source technologies such as Kubernetes and JupyterHub to deliver: 1) a hardened, production-grade platform that can support hundreds of projects running across thousands of nodes geographically distributed across dozens of academic clusters; 2) deep integration with advanced storage and computing resources available in existing science gateways; 3) Sharing and publishing features allowing analyses to be packaged with data and shared privately with collaborators or disseminated to the community at large. Diverse areas of research, including Astronomy, Biology, Climate Science, Neuroscience, and various fields of Engineering will leverage the SCINCO platform to analyze big data, implement computational models, disseminate results and train the next generation of researchers.
