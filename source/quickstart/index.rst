Step 2: Try the JupyterHub server running at TACC

Log in at jupyter.tacc.cloud to start a server with your TACC credentials

Step 3: Evaluate whether your scientific use-case needs a dedicated JuyterHub instance. If so follow the steps below:
    1. Email to cicsupport@tacc.utexas.edu with a breif description of your use case and requesting a meeting time.
    2. During the meeting, explain your use-case to our staff members and mention the memory and CPU requirements for running your use-case.
    3. Mention any specific packages that should be loaded in the JupyterHub for running your experiments.
    4. Our staff will guide you from there.
